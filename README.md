# Clothing-Classification
A machine learning model which classifies between different type of clothing
The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaiska/apparel-dataset
The model is then trained, validated and tested on above dataset.
When a clothing image is passed through this model it will return the image while classifing it based on it type e.g black dress
The model also shows confidence score.
This was just a practice model, do contact me if it can be improved.
